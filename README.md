## Font and Color - 10%
***
Create 5 pages. Each page is going to have a header, hr, and paragraph text. Each page is going to have a different theme. You need to choose a font pairing from google fonts, and a color pairing that matches the theme. The themes are:

* [Sophisticated](https://assignment-one-dyjjspqqnt.now.sh/sophisticated "Sophisticated")
* [Energetic](https://assignment-one-dyjjspqqnt.now.sh/energetic "Energetic")
* [Relaxed](https://assignment-one-dyjjspqqnt.now.sh/relaxed "Relaxed")
* [Corporate](https://assignment-one-dyjjspqqnt.now.sh/corporate "Corporate")
* [Fun](https://assignment-one-dyjjspqqnt.now.sh/fun "Fun")

You must specify what strategy you are using for color. Here are the options:

* One Color
* Analogous
* Complementary
* Split Complementary
* Triad
* Material Design

I will be giving 5 points for each page for a total of 25 points:

1. Is the HTML and CSS properly indented?
2. Do all the links work on the page?
3. Are the fonts properly imported?
4. Is the font easy to read?
5. Are you using one of the strategies we went over for color?
